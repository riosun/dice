This is how it works:<br/><br/>You can enter your own SEED to the TRON.network. If you don't enter your own SEED, then a public random SEED will be used.<br/><br/>When the player places a bet and enters their own SEED, the smart contract will generate a random SHA-256 HASH, the timestamp of the current bet, and the previous blockhash from coinbase will be mixed to generate a random hash. The SEED generated from the smart contract and the SEED provided by the player will then be mixed to generate a random LUCKY number.",

DICE Token hodlers will be paid DICEdrops in TRX depending on how many DICE Tokens they own.<br/><br/><span style='color:#fff; font-weight:800'>What is DICEdrops? And why do DICEdrops fluctuate?</span><br/> DICEdrops are derived from E-gaming’s net revenue, in other words the house edge.  The Windrop pool will fluctuate constantly depending on users winning and losing on E-gaming.<br/><br/><span style='color:#fff; font-weight:800'>Can we purchase DICE?</span><br/> DICE cannot be bought directly, and can only be mined just by playing on E-gaming.

DICE will be with you forever unless you decide to exchange it on a DEX.  As long as you have DICE in your wallet, you will receive DICEdrops from E-gaming.
